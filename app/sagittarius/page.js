        <h2>Personality Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Sagittarius is the zodiac’s eternal explorer, driven by a love for freedom, knowledge, and new experiences. 
          Ruled by Jupiter, the planet of growth and expansion, Sagittarians have an infectious optimism and a philosophical 
          outlook on life. They are adventurous spirits who seek to broaden their horizons through travel, learning, 
          and meaningful conversations.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Known for their honesty and straightforwardness, Sagittarians value truth and integrity, sometimes 
          to the point of bluntness. Their independent nature means they dislike feeling confined and thrive when 
          given space to roam and discover.
        </p>
  
        <h2>Love & Compatibility</h2>
        <p>
          Sagittarius pairs well with fellow Fire signs (Aries, Leo), who share their passion and energy, and Air signs 
          (Libra, Aquarius), who stimulate their mind and love of adventure.

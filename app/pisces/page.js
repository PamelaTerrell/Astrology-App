        <h2>Personality Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Pisces is the zodiac’s empathetic dreamer, deeply in tune with emotions and the unseen world. 
          Ruled by Neptune, the planet of imagination and spirituality, Pisces individuals are known for 
          their compassionate nature and artistic talents. They often have a gentle, intuitive approach to life, 
          seeing beauty where others might miss it.

        <p>
          Pisces tend to be sensitive and selfless, sometimes to the point of absorbing the feelings of those 
          around them. Their dreamy disposition fuels creativity and a love of music, poetry, and mysticism. 
          They seek connection on a soulful level and are often the healers and counselors among friends and family.
        </p>
  
        <h2>Love & Compatibility</h2>
        <p>
          Pisces often connects deeply with fellow Water signs (Cancer, Scorpio), who understand their emotional depth, 
          and Earth signs (Taurus, Capricorn), who provide stability and grounding.

        <h2>Personality Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Libra is the zodiac’s peacemaker, guided by a deep desire for balance, harmony, and justice. Ruled 
          by Venus, the planet of love and beauty, Libras are naturally charming and have a strong aesthetic 
          sense. They seek fairness in all areas of life and are gifted at seeing multiple perspectives, making 
          them excellent mediators and friends.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Libras thrive in social settings where they can connect with others and cultivate meaningful relationships.
          However, their indecisiveness can sometimes slow them down, as they weigh options carefully to maintain 
          equilibrium. Their love of beauty and art often drives them toward creative pursuits.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Love & Compatibility</h2>
        <p>
          Libra finds great compatibility with fellow Air signs (Gemini, Aquarius), who stimulate their intellect, 
          and Fire signs (Leo, Sagittarius), who inspire their passion and creativity.

      <h2>Personality Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Taurus is the steady rock of the zodiac — grounded, dependable, and deeply connected
        to the sensual world. Governed by Venus, the planet of beauty and love, Taurus individuals
        are lovers of comfort, luxury, and stability. They value consistency and loyalty in all aspects
        of life — from relationships to work to personal rituals.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        While they may be slow to change or overly stubborn at times, their persistence and patience
        often lead to great success. A Taurus will stick with something — or someone — long after others have
        given up, driven by a quiet strength and deep sense of purpose.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Love & Compatibility</h2>
      <p>
        Taurus pairs well with other Earth signs (Virgo, Capricorn) for shared values and grounded goals,
        and with Water signs (Cancer, Pisces) who provide emotional depth and complement Taurus’s nurturing side.

      <h2>Personality Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Gemini is the zodiac’s social butterfly — lively, quick-witted, and endlessly curious. 
        Ruled by Mercury, the planet of communication, Geminis thrive on exchanging ideas, 
        learning new things, and making connections with others. Their dual nature, symbolized 
        by the Twins, means they can effortlessly switch between moods and interests, keeping 
        life exciting for themselves and those around them.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Geminis are natural conversationalists and love exploring different perspectives, but 
        their restlessness can sometimes make them seem inconsistent or indecisive. They crave variety 
        and mental stimulation, and often excel in environments that reward adaptability and creativity.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Love & Compatibility</h2>
      <p>
        Gemini often connects well with fellow Air signs (Libra, Aquarius) who appreciate their intellectual 
        agility, and Fire signs (Aries, Leo) who match their energy and enthusiasm.

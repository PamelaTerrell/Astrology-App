      <h2>Personality Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Scorpio is known for its intensity and emotional depth, often described as one of the most powerful 
        and magnetic signs of the zodiac. Ruled by Mars and Pluto, Scorpios have a strong will and a natural 
        ability to transform themselves and situations around them. They are fiercely loyal and protective 
        of those they love, often keeping their true feelings hidden beneath a calm exterior.
      </p>

      <p>
        With their keen intuition and penetrating gaze, Scorpios are masters of understanding the hidden 
        motives of others. Their passion fuels both their relationships and pursuits, though they can sometimes 
        be secretive or possessive. Scorpios thrive in situations that challenge them to dive deep and emerge 
        stronger.

      <h2>Love & Compatibility</h2>
      <p>
        Scorpio connects well with fellow Water signs (Cancer, Pisces), who share their emotional intensity, and 
        Earth signs (Taurus, Virgo), who provide stability and grounding.
